TODO Shy:
2. Build logic for each view - almost complete
3. Make data displayable in each view - I THINK this is done?
4. Implement Regex for textual data (ID, Address, Name...) + set in all suitable nodes

TODOs Ran:
1. Make sure all unique behavior in AddX views work!
2. Implement THE RED SHINY BUTTON ("File a Complaint") XD
3. Implement some kind of EE
4. Open addCandidateToParty only if a party is selected, and send that party as a parameter
5. Add tooltip for regex format (i.e. 9 digit for citizen id)
6. Set default value for each control in every add{X}View, as to not mess around with nulls
7. get images of V and X for status columns instead of checkboxes
8. delete all remove {X} buttons - ain't no one's gonna mess with that!

TODOs BOTH:
1. Comment important code pieces
